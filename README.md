# REMWaste Skip Size Redesign

## Project Overview

This project is a React-based redesign of the **“Choose Your Skip Size”** page for REMWaste, aiming to modernize the user interface while preserving the core functionality. The redesign focuses on improving usability, accessibility, and responsiveness for both desktop and mobile web users.

## Approach and Key Features

- **Data Integration:**  
  Skip size options are dynamically fetched from the REMWaste API endpoint based on postcode input, ensuring the displayed skips reflect accurate availability by location.

- **Component-Based Architecture:**  
  The UI is composed of modular, reusable React components (`SkipSelection`, `SkipCard`, `Progress`, etc.) written in TypeScript, providing type safety and easier maintainability.

- **Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS:**  
  Tailwind CSS utility classes are heavily utilized to create a clean, responsive grid and layout that adapts smoothly from mobile devices to large desktops. This approach keeps styling consistent and minimal in CSS files.

- **User Experience Enhancements:**  
  - Clear visual highlights indicate the currently selected skip.  
  - Interactive skip cards support keyboard navigation (`Enter` and `Space` keys), improving accessibility.  
  - VAT-inclusive pricing is calculated dynamically and displayed clearly.

- **Accessibility Considerations:**  
  Semantic HTML roles, keyboard focus management, and clear visual feedback make the interface usable by screen readers and keyboard-only users.

## How to Build and Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)  
- **pnpm** (Fast, efficient package manager)  

If you don’t have `pnpm` installed, you can install it globally with:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

More info at the official pnpm site: [https://pnpm.io/installation](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/remwaste-skip-redesign.git
cd remwaste-skip-redesign
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the local development server with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```



## Technologies Used

- **React** with **TypeScript** for scalable, type-safe component development.  
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive styling. Tailwind was configured with JIT mode for optimal performance and fast builds.  
- Fetch API and React hooks handle asynchronous data fetching and state management efficiently.  
- Accessibility best practices incorporated with ARIA roles, keyboard interaction support, and semantic HTML.

## Deployment

The app is automatically deployed via **Netlify** on every push to the main branch. This ensures that the live version is always up to date with the latest code.
